        <h2>The story</h2>
            <p>
                Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q> 
            </p>
            <p>
                The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villagers">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q>
            </p>

            <p>
                The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <b class="good">good</b> or <b class="bad">bad</b> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <b class="good">good</b> fortune.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            <b class="good">Good</b> and <b class="bad">Bad</b> are just one perspective. Bananas are <b class="good">good</b> for monkeys, but monkeys are <b class="bad">not good</b> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
